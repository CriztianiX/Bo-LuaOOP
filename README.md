Introduction
============

Bo-Lua OOP is a Java-like Lua Object Oriented Programming (OOP) implementation. 
Its purpose is to give the power of the Object-Oriented Programming to Lua and at the same time 
to keep itself as simple as possible, because of this, not all the Object-Oriented Programming features 
are supported by PLxPLs Lua OOP. Unlike the other Lua OOP implementation, PLxPLs Lua OOP enables multple 
inheritance through interface, which is from the concept of Java. The implemented features of PLxPLs Lua 
OOP are listed below:
